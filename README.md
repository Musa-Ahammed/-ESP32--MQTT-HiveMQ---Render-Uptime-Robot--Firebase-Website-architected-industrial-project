# Real-Time IoT Environmental Monitoring & Automation System
Stack: ESP32 (C++) · MQTT/HiveMQ Cloud · Render · Node.js · UptimeRobot · Firebase Realtime DB · Chart.js· Git

Designed and deployed an end-to-end, bidirectional IoT telemetry and automation ecosystem for real-time air quality monitoring and automated emergency infrastructure response (simulated for an ATM node environment).

The project features a high-frequency data pipeline that streams sensor data to a cloud database while allowing low-latency remote hardware control via an interactive web dashboard. Implemented modern cloud engineering strategies to maintain 24/7 service uptime on micro-tier infrastructure.

Key Features & Architecture
Edge Hardware Layer: Programmed an ESP32 microcontroller in C++ to sample environmental gas levels and establish a secure, encrypted TLS 1.2 connection to the cloud broker.

Data Transport & Middleware: Utilized MQTT (via HiveMQ Cloud) over port 8883 for lightweight data ingestion. Developed a Node.js backend bridge hosted on Render to subscribe to MQTT streams, format telemetry payloads, and handle database transactions.

Cloud Database & Operations: Integrated Firebase Realtime Database for persistent storage, optimizing database performance through custom indices (.indexOn: ["timestamp"]). Configured automated HTTP keep-alive pings (UptimeRobot) to bypass server inactivity spin-down rules, ensuring continuous availability.

Frontend Control Matrix: Engineered a responsive, dark-mode web dashboard utilizing Chart.js for real-time and historical analytics (Time-Travel queries for "Last 1 Hour" and "Yesterday"). Integrated a web-audio notification matrix and low-latency digital switch paths for remote mechanical actuation (relays/actuators).

Technical Stack
Hardware/Firmware: ESP32, C++, Arduino IDE, PubSubClient, ArduinoJson, TLS 1.2

Backend & Cloud: Node.js, MQTT (HiveMQ Cloud), Firebase Realtime Database, Render

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+), Chart.js, Web Audio API

DevOps/Monitoring: UptimeRobot, Git/GitHub
